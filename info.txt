Low testosterone levels
=======================
https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-testosterone#low-t-levels

Low levels of testosterone, also called low T levels, can produce a variety of symptoms in men, including:

decreased sex drive
less energy
weight gain
feelings of depression
moodiness
low self-esteem
less body hair
thinner bones

While testosterone production naturally tapers off as a man ages, other factors 
can cause hormone levels to drop.

Injury to the testicles and cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation 
can negatively affect testosterone production.

Chronic health conditions and stress can also reduce testosterone production. 
Some of these include:

AIDS
kidney disease
alcoholism
cirrhosis of the live



Boost testosterone
==================
            
The best exercises to *boost testosterone* are 
*resistance/strength training or weight training*. 
Strength training that uses large muscle groups boosts testosterone 
more than smaller muscles.
        
This means squats can increase testosterone 
levels more than doing push-ups on their own since the muscles in the 
legs are larger than the ones in your arms, though push-ups can still 
be a great part of a full-body workout. 

            
*High intensity interval training (HIIT)* can boost testosterone levels. 
This is a style of working out that involves doing 
intense sprints of cardio with short rest periods. 
HIIT works well because it’s a major form of exercise that can help 
*expand your lung capacity*.

HIIT is one of the main forms of exercise that can expand lung capacity, 
so you can take in more oxygen and build lean muscle mass which produces 
more testosterone. 
It’s a good mechanism to build testosterone naturally.

*Endurance training* such as long-distance running or cycling has many benefits 
to your body and mind. However, endurance exercise won’t 
boost testosterone levels because longer exercises increase cortisol levels 
and limit the amount of testosterone being produced, says Dr. Swartzon. 

If you run or cycle, it might be a good idea to mix up your workouts 
with different types of exercise such as 
HIIT and weight-lifting to reap the benefits of a testosterone boost.
