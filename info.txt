Boost testosterone
==================
            
The best exercises to *boost testosterone* are 
*resistance/strength training or weight training*. 
Strength training that uses large muscle groups boosts testosterone 
more than smaller muscles.
        
This means squats can increase testosterone 
levels more than doing push-ups on their own since the muscles in the 
legs are larger than the ones in your arms, though push-ups can still 
be a great part of a full-body workout. 

            
*High intensity interval training (HIIT)* can boost testosterone levels. 
This is a style of working out that involves doing 
intense sprints of cardio with short rest periods. 
HIIT works well because it’s a major form of exercise that can help 
*expand your lung capacity*.

HIIT is one of the main forms of exercise that can expand lung capacity, 
so you can take in more oxygen and build lean muscle mass which produces 
more testosterone. 
It’s a good mechanism to build testosterone naturally.

*Endurance training* such as long-distance running or cycling has many benefits 
to your body and mind. However, endurance exercise won’t 
boost testosterone levels because longer exercises increase cortisol levels 
and limit the amount of testosterone being produced, says Dr. Swartzon. 

If you run or cycle, it might be a good idea to mix up your workouts 
with different types of exercise such as 
HIIT and weight-lifting to reap the benefits of a testosterone boost.
